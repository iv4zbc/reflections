How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Easier. Faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Restore changes more efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: save your advance when you consider its time.
    Cons: Because it's subjective, depends on the programmer when to save the
      work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The commit as a whole. In each commit you have the complete project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With 'git log' you view the information about the commits. With 'git diff'
     you can compare two commits with the ID's of the commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's great can modify one version of the code. Make changes, test code.
    Restore with git checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use in my projects. Practice, practice.
