Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than giving Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Stability. With new changes take much time reviewing the new modifications.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When you would
use one instead of another?

  Fork is a copy of the other repository in GitHub. Clone is a copy of the one
  repository into the local machine. Branch is a series of commits with a name.

  Generally you don't have permissions from someone repository, then you can
  fork that repository and make your own changes. You clone one repository for
  work in your own machine. You create a branch to test some new features, or
  try to fix things.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  Merge your changes with the last known change of the remote repository.
